![](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)


## Installation

## Overview
* Public databases APIs: `STRING`, `BioGRID`, `KEGG`, `Reactome` and `WikiPathway`
* Functional set based and network based enrichment analysis algorithms implemented: `ORA`, `GSEA` and `SPIA`
* Performance optimize for denovo enrichment algorithm `MAGI` and `Hotnet2`.
* Interactive visualization for pathway, graph and analysis result.
* Web page exportation for results.

## Features
* Integrated with numpy and networkx
* Dynamic visualization for IPython notebook
* Most classes implement `__repr__` method for interactive environment

## Network process

APIs for querying and retrieval interaction network from public database. The return object are stored in networkx graph object.
